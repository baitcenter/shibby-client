## Priority

- [X] Database connection
  - [ ] Setup warnings
  - [ ] Investigate the Vuex-ORM axios plugin
- [X] Soundgasm crawler
  - [ ]Partially complete, still requires crawler to index a user
- [X] Soundgasm api
- [X] Search files
- [ ] Tag filter
  - [ ] potentially solved by https://github.com/InnerSearch/vue-innersearch
- [V] Auto tagger
  - [ ] Auto tagger works, still needs to strip away tags from string
- [ ] Audio backup
- [ ] Series based on tag?
  - [ ] Problably better to add separate series and episode object to soundObjects.
  - [ ] Alternative is seperate List and ORM relationships
