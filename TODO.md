# TODO

- [P] Database connection
  - Setup warnings
- Soundgasm crawler
  - Partially complete, still requires crawler to index a user
- [V] Soundgasm api
- Search files
- Tag filter
  - potentially solved by https://github.com/InnerSearch/vue-innersearch
- [V] Auto tagger
  - Auto tagger works, still needs to strip away tags from string
- Audio player, ensure song plays during navigation
- Audio backup
- Playlist
- Series based on tag?
  - Problably better to add separate series and episode object to soundObjects.
- Admin login
